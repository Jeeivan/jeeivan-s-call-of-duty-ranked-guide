# jeeivan-s-call-of-duty-ranked-guide
This project involved the use of inputs to make my own menu for a program that demonstrates a guide with a variety of tips for players. This also involves adding entries to a dictionary. To make my project more complex I included reading and writing to files, the data stored in these files are the dictionaries used in the program, meaning any additions the user makes the data will be saved for the next time the application is used.
