# jeeivan-s-call-of-duty-ranked-guide
This is a personal project that I have developed, it combines all the skills that I have learnt. This project involved the use of inputs to make my own menu for a program that demonstrates a guide with a variety of tips for players. This project involved the use of dictionaries, if statements and error handling, functions.
